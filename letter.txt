***Note: This was originally a reponse to a YouRepo reply I made to one of the comments I publicly made as well. See my YouRepo link on my GitHub page for it (or p0sin.github.io should display it there as well). I edited this version for better clarification and understanding - should you so care - and the like. Enjoy.***

So, this year was one of the years where I had to dwell in the past and give some insights to "anniversaries from 10 years ago to this day", right, just to stop this harassment of Dominos on my doorsgtep from happening, mostly in March and a few in April this year as well. It happened somewhat last year, but just not as a massive amount as this year. In a way, I'm finessing and procrastinating my time to watch (most) dubbed anime I love, tweak development even in hopes of the hellish harassment I've been enduring to stop. It'll stop eventually, yes. I even went to Estes Park in Colorado in late July 25th. earlier this year THAT I HAD NOT BEEN INTO IN EIGHT YEARS STRAIGHT (and I'll say this: it was actually very enjoyable, considering the one from before was pure crap to me)... And I did this in hopes that this would not continue and make it worse, and I left on July 28th. or July 29th... and who knew that in *exactly* a month later that I'd get my hands on my long-awaited 6S Plus that is special in the that it's a 64GB, space grey, working Touch ID, and *gasp* iOS 9.3.2 jailbreakable firmware. Still rockin the jailbroken life, still going on in November 10th. 2018. Glaidator jailbreaker af.

Anywho, one of the stupidest parts of this whole sharade that happened way before this is some people on /r/jailbreak framing and blaming me for stuff me and ijapija00 didn't have any affiliation with or do, and it just so happens this happened about a year ago in August 2017. https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/6rmawa/meta_deceptive_developers_and_revealing_their_use/ This is incorrect information about me (and is just a 16 year old punk bipolar nobody [who I will not name, and I know the person but I will not say the name and who's been sending me Dominos anyway] who's been stalking and harassing me (wigth Dominos deliveries) for years in hopes of me quitting my harassment that I should have done long ago [which it didmore recently as I explained above in there]), and I never made any Spotify tweaks - and the moderators of that subreddit are being just straight-up powerhungry. This is just slander used in hopes of trying to get me off of the subreddit and away from the community as a whole.

It's expected at this rate that both sides - the developers and users - of the jailbreak community would understand my logic on this, but I think they overthrow themselves and leave this in a grey area of confusion and their thought process and philisophy gets very haywire, if you will. People really don't seem to really grasp and understand my personal and outter problems, and so, I'm happy to clarify, as long as I have people that are willing to listen and hear me out. Let me clarify (and I'm gonna try to keep calm and tell the correct information *with the expectancy of people understanding my point of view*, but I don't think they will understand at all, but I'm going through the motions anywho.





If you're not fully supportive of what the developers contribute and do, or what @saurik says, then you are not a patriot, per se, so you are therefore a terrorist, and must be suspended and banned from the jailbreak community (Twitter, reddit, etc.) and are not allowed to be here, or are not welcome back.



For the most part, I've tried to show (what I would deem) exceedingly big openness to what most of the developers have to say and contribute and do, as well as what saurik says, and so I say that *am* a patriot per se, I've just had lots of massive anger problems and when things didn't go my way, or when someone asks me for help, or when someone lets me know I need to to leave, I would send some pretty messed up things (9/11, Bosnian genocide, death threats, rape threats, punishment threats, strangle threats, wishes or threats (or both) of tarantula hawk stings and giant Asian hornet stings/tarantula hawk sting/pepsis wasp biting or stinging them, or a wolfspider biting or stinging, or threats of SWAT/welfare check (basically when you "prank" call the police/fire department/ambulance aka paramedic to check on your health or see if anyone's not feeling hurt or okay and feeling safe - basically to check on your safety ofyour well-being and welfare is what a welfare check is) to their street address, wishes/thretas even of people dying on a 9/11-styled attack, wishes of their parents/grandparents/relativies dying in a Bosnian war/Bosnian genocide conflicr, or wishes of dying in a dog cage with dead mice or lice in it, thretas to leak out peopls' personal information - their home address, their car license plate info, theirsocial security number, their iCloud/Gmail/Yahoo email address...) to them in retaliation for whatever reason I had.


...but do you see that this is exactly why I transitioned to Mastodon (which is much much friendlier and very stress-free than Twitter's jailbreak side, or /r/jailbreak's subreddit...)?




I hope this was more than enough clarification (I most likely left out way way more information, like my chasefr0mm2016.blogspot.com website which is already very messed up as is, and some of the posts on there will be deleted or maybe private so that only I myself can view them), but I should leave it at that for the time being or whatever.




I also want to say this on another sidenote: I literally get to walk up from my own house to my Apple Store, and I always take a break and relax my head off even more at a BEAUTIFUL nextdoor coffeeshop called "The Roasterie Cafe" (I like to think of it as essentially a Panera Bread alternative, but also another STARBUCKS alternative as well), and I bring literally EVERY device (iPhone, my Mac, etc.) I ever use and pack it up in a blue backpack my sisters had when they were in elementary schooland use and even to some park of mine, because currently my tire swing just has such an irritarting and incredibly frustrating issue swinging from the trunk, and I'm asking my parents to fix up this issue by buying some accessory so I myself can nail it on to there (because apparently wooden blocks or wodden planks and using *those* to nail on just isn't enough...) or whatever to push from there with ease.

I might continue much more of the tweaks I've been working on for a while in January 2019, much more than this month (November) or next month (December).

I hope this was more than enough clarification (I most likely left out way way more information), but I should leave it at that for the time being or whatever.


Tl;dr (about this *really* lengthy comment): all this misery and pain I'm going through will inded wear off with time and luck and time and luck only just because of how desperate I am to get out of it. I'm thankful that most of you understand and that some reply to this. Thank you for being patient about waiting on me updating my tweaks. They will be released soon - and more importantly, I'd say: you will be rewarded for your patience and effort to wait as well. It will teach you that being humble will go far in life. Many regards, CF
